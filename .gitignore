in worker loging career path ai my manager says the roadmap look good but its not the actual career developmant roadmap it is a bunch of recomendation and not all persons can came with all skills like mastering python, networking, cloud they are humans not ai


INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the SINGLE most important skill gap between current state and target role.
2. Create a detailed learning path for THAT ONE skill first.
3. Each step must be highly detailed with:
   - WHAT: Exactly what to learn/do (specific topics, not vague areas)
   - WHY: How this directly helps achieve the target role
   - HOW: Step-by-step approach (e.g., "Start with Chapter 1-3 of X book, then practice with Y exercise...")
   - SUCCESS CRITERIA: How to know when you've completed this step
   - COMMON PITFALLS: What mistakes to avoid
4. Steps should be small enough to complete in 1-2 weeks with part-time effort.
5. Include practical exercises and mini-projects, not just "learn X".
6. After the primary skill path, add 1-2 secondary skills as "Phase 2" for later.


CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:
1. **ONE SKILL AT A TIME**: Humans cannot learn Python, networking, cloud, and databases simultaneously. Focus on ONE primary skill path that leads to the target role. Other skills are "nice to have" for later.
2. **REALISTIC TIMELINES**: A working professional has limited time. Each step should be achievable in the stated timeframe with 5-10 hours/week of effort.
3. **DEPTH OVER BREADTH**: It's better to be genuinely competent in 2-3 skills than superficially aware of 10 skills.
4. **SEQUENTIAL PROGRESSION**: Each step MUST build on the previous one. No jumping to advanced topics without prerequisites.
5. **PRACTICAL PROFICIENCY, NOT MASTERY**: The goal is "can do the job effectively" not "world-class expert".
